## Introduction
For this project, I use  `React` for the front-end framework with `Material-UI` and `Ant-Design` for UI part. 

I also use `GraphQL` on  `Express Server` instead of Restful API since firstly, GraphQL has many advantages as for a new technology compared with Restful API. Secondly, Restful API will be too simple for this code challenge. 

For database I use Mysql as required with `Sequelize` as ORM and  `sequelize-cli` to create and migrate database. 

In terms of Deployment I use `docker-compose`  for backend in `api` folder, please find the further instruction in
 `api/README.md` and `configurator/README.md`
